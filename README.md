# Homework task 1: Refactoring

## Link


### Changes made: 
The headers are now in order from <h1> to <h6>.
The <div></div> tags have all been changed to the correct semantic elements. 
The CSS follows the same order as the HTML doc.
alt attributes have been added to each image to make them more accessible.
The correct indentation has been used.
The URL of this image: "./assets\images\digital-marketing-meeting.jpg" has been moved to the HTML doc to make it more accessible for screen readers. 
There are comments in the CSS file to explain definitions. 
I have avoided repetition in the CSS file by using the class "all-benefits" to add styles to the side bar of the page. 
All of the links are fully functional. 
Some of the class names have been changed in the HTML doc, with the corresponding class changed in the CSS file.
