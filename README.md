1. The headers are now in order from h1 to h6.

5. The URL of this image: "./assets\images\digital-marketing-meeting.jpg" has been moved to the HTML doc to make it more accessible for screen readers.
6. There are comments in the CSS file to explain definitions.
7. I have avoided repetition in the CSS file by using the class "all-benefits" to add styles to the side bar of the page.
8. All of the links are fully functional.
9. Some of the class names have been changed in the HTML doc, with the corresponding class changed in the CSS file.
